    <h2>Fell for Fall</h2>
    <p>I'm falling hard this fall,
      But at least the view is pretty.
      It's hard to stand tall,
      When you're given looks of pity.

      Yet, watching the leaves,
      Softly descending upon my feet,
      Makes it easier for me to believe,
      There are still things left sweet.

      I'd kick them freely into the air,
      With a childlike smile upon my face,
      As if I had time to spare,
      Distracted from life's frantic race.

      Just watching the colors fly,
      Makes me giggle and cry,
      And I could blame the cold,
      But I'll embrace the panorama of gold.

      The colors I once thought I'd lost,
      Now flush red upon my cheeks,
      And on the leaves of trees,
      A glimpse of happiness, the wind speaks.

      I wish every day could be like this,
      But soon they'll all be bare,
      And I'm scared I'll have to miss,
      Saying goodbye to those I care.</p>

    <h2>Fell for Fall</h2>
    <p>
      I'm falling hard this fall,<br>
      But at least the view is pretty.<br>
      It's hard to stand tall,<br>
      When you're given looks of pity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yet, watching the leaves,<br>
      Softly descending upon my feet,<br>
      Makes it easier for me to believe,<br>
      There are still things left sweet.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'd kick them freely into the air,<br>
      With a childlike smile upon my face,<br>
      As if I had time to spare,<br>
      Distracted from life's frantic race.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just watching the colors fly,<br>
      Makes me giggle and cry,<br>
      And I could blame the cold,<br>
      But I'll embrace the panorama of gold.
    </p>

    <p>
      The colors I once thought I'd lost,<br>
      Now flush red upon my cheeks,<br>
      And on the leaves of trees,<br>
      A glimpse of happiness, the wind speaks.
    </p>

    <p>
      I wish every day could be like this,<br>
      But soon they'll all be bare,<br>
      And I'm scared I'll have to miss,<br>
      Saying goodbye to those I care.
    </p>
